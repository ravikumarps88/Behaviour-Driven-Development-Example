=========
This is a simple SOAP API project to get the weather of a country.

The main purpose of this project is to get start with BDD (Behaviour Driven Development) using Behat.

You can find the Behat scripts under the "feature" folder.
There is a file named "FeatureContext_Old.php" , which is done using older version of Behat. So if you want to run that one, need to change the file name, change the version of behat in conposer.json and run composer update.

Because of size issue, Iam not uploading the vendor folder, So you need to update the vendor folder to use the project.
